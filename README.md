# Base CalSim3 template for COEQWAL - s9999_template

This repository contains CalSim3 model files that serve as the basis for development of COEQWAL scenarios.
Changes to files in this repository should, where possible, be created with a mechanism to select or switch a conditionon/off or across specific levels. 
Ideally, changes should be made and tested locally before being pushed back to this repository. 
Code changes that add new functionality should be pushed in a default "off" condition - i.e. that it does not change the baseline behavior or outcomes from the model
